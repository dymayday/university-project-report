\chapter{Displayed Text}
Use the ``quote'' and ``quotation'' environments for typesetting quoted
material or any other text that should be slightly indented and set off
from the normal text.
\begin{quotation}
The quote and quotation environments are similar, but use different
settings for paragraph indentation and spacing.

\em When in doubt, consult the manual.
\end{quotation}

So far, I have demonstrated titles, paragraphs, font changes, and
section headings.
